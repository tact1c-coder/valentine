              My Love,
              <br />
              Happy Valentine‚Äôs Day, Khana, my beautiful princess!
              <br />
              I don‚Äôt think words will ever be enough to tell you how much you
              mean to me, but I‚Äôll try my best. Every single day, I find myself
              falling for you all over again‚Äî in the way you laugh, the way you
              smile, in the beautiful way your eyes sparkle, the way you see the
              world, the way you just are. You are the most incredible person I
              have ever known, and I am endlessly grateful to have you in my
              life. Being with you feels like warmth on a cold day, like a
              melody that never stops sounding beautiful. You make everything
              brighter, softer, and more meaningful just by being yourself. I
              love the way you think, the way you dream, and the way your
              presence alone makes everything feel right. You make me want to be
              the best version of myself, not because you ask me to, but because
              loving you makes me feel like I can do anything. I hope you always
              know that I am here for you, through every high and every low,
              every moment big and small. No matter what happens, no matter
              where life takes us, you will always have my heart. You are my
              favorite person, my best friend, my love. Happy Valentine‚Äôs Day,
              my love. Here‚Äôs to us, to every moment we‚Äôve shared, and to the
              many more to come.
              <br />
              I love you so, so, sooooo soooo very much, Khana, more than you
              could ever imagine. Btw, click on the small heart for a surprise!
              <br />
              Forever yours,
              <br />
              Kent
